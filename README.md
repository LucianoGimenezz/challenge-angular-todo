```

### Run the application locally

```

2 - Install project dependencies:
```bash
  npm install --force

3 - Start the development server:

### Dockerize the application

Follow these steps to run the angular application in a Docker container:

## Running Cypress Tests

To execute Cypress tests you can use the following methods:

### Normal Mode

To run Cypress tests in normal mode (with an interactive graphical user interface), use the following command:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

### Headless mode

if you want to run Cypress tests in headless mode (without a graphical user interface), you can use the following command.
